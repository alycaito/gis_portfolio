# Final Project - Survey Data Collection Monitoring Dashboard

### Motivation
Having managed several field data collection teams (in Ghana and Rwanda), the field data collection progress and quality monitoring could benefit from having a clear and easily shareable analytics dashboard that includes geospatial tracking. Projects typically use the SurveyCTO platform for mobile offline data collection, which allows for the creation of complex surveys but has very weak data visualization capabilities to be used effectively for monitoring. Project associates typically import the data in Stata and check the incoming data there, which is not ideal for sharing with field staff. Additionally, although GPS coordinates are collected, they are rarely used in the survey data collection planning or monitoring process.

Thus, a monitoring dashboard that is easily updatable could help streamline the monitoring process and make helpful analytics for decision-making more accessible in the fast-paced work environment. The field supervisors and team leaders typically use internet-enabled tablets so having a web-based dashboard that can easily be accessed by them will vastly improve their access to key monitoring analytics and enable better remote collaboration. Project associates may still use Stata for deeper analysis, but a dashboard would simplify the day-to-day monitoring activities.

### Deliverables
1) <b>Demo monitoring dashboard:<b\> A demo dashboard using ArcGIS dashboards to showcase how data collection progress and survey quality monitoring can be enhanced with maps and other visualizations. The demo dashboard will serve as a template that staff can use to create new, project-specific dashboards. The demo uses survey data from a completed project in Rwanda.
2) Instructions for set-up and modification: Comprehensive video instructions for setting-up the dashboard for a data collection project (connecting to data) or modifying the template to fit project needs intended for a project associate that is data-savvy but unfamiliar with Esri and/or geospatial data.
3) Instructions for use: A brief video guide on how to navigate the platform as a user; intended for project associates and for non-technical users such as field supervisors.
