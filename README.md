## About Me
My name is Aly Caito and I am finishing my final semester of my Master of Public Policy and Management degree at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm from Rochester, NY but have been living in Pittsburgh since 2011, when I started my undergraduate degree in economics at the University of Pittsburgh. Prior to coming to CMU for my graduate degree, I worked as a research manager for several randomized control trials related to micro-entrepreneurship in Ghana, Rwanda, India, and Mexico. Broadly my policy interests fall under the umbrella of poverty and inequality, both internationally and domestically. Locally, I'm interested in the topics of affordable housing and workforce development. In my free time, I enjoy cooking/baking and watercolor painting, 

## What I hope to learn
I'm looking forward to improving my spatial data analysis skills and understanding of what can be done in GIS. I hope that it will help me in identifying real-world opportunities for geospatial analysis. I really like GIS as a visualization tool as well, and therefore hope that I'll learn more ways to create powerful visualizations. I also hope that I will gain more confidence in scoping and managing GIS projects, as this is what I would likely be doing in the workplace.
