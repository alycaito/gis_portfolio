## About Me
My name is Aly Caito and I am finishing my final semester of my Master of Public Policy and Management degree at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm from Rochester, NY but have been living in Pittsburgh since 2011, when I started my undergraduate degree in economics at the University of Pittsburgh. Prior to coming to CMU for my graduate degree, I worked as a research manager for several randomized control trials related to micro-entrepreneurship in Ghana, Rwanda, India, and Mexico. Broadly my policy interests fall under the umbrella of poverty and inequality, both internationally and domestically. Locally, I'm interested in the topics of affordable housing and workforce development. In my free time, I enjoy cooking/baking and watercolor painting.

## What I hope to learn
I'm looking forward to improving my spatial data analysis skills and understanding of what can be done in GIS. I hope that it will help me in identifying real-world opportunities for geospatial analysis. I really like GIS as a visualization tool as well, and therefore hope that I'll learn more ways to create powerful visualizations. I also hope that I will gain more confidence in scoping and managing GIS projects, as this is what I would likely be doing in the workplace.

## Reflections & what I learned
In this course I had the opportunity to explore ArcGIS insights, learn about spatial data analysis tools available in ArcGIS Pro, learn how ArcGIS notebooks can be used to integrate ArcGIS with python and document workflows, and be exposed to other GIS tools (e.g. Mapbox). As a result of this course I feel more comfortable using a variety of Esri tools as well as branching out beyond Esri if it is not available to me in the future. In my final project, I used ArcGIS Dashboards, which I had never used before and enjoyed learning. While, its functionality is basic, it's still flexible enough to create useful dashboards for a variety of purposes. I also learned multiple ways to update point data layers in real-time. In the final project, I had to do my own research through Esri and outside resources on how to accomplish my goals, which has improved my confidence in tackling GIS projects that I might not fully know how to complete.

## Portfolio
In assignment 1, I created I customed google basemap for Literacy Pittsburgh according to their website theme.
