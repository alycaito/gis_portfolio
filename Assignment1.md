# Assignment 1 - Web map for Literacy Pittsburgh

## Client and website design
The non-profit I chose to create a custom map for is Literacy Pittsburgh, which provides literacy services to adults and families in Allegheny County and Beaver County. I used to volunteer for this organization as an ESL tutor years ago.

Below is a screenshot from one page of their website to illustrate their color scheme.

## Color Palette

I used the Adobe Color tool to select the color palette from the screenshot I took (see image below). I also took another screenshot of the bottom banner of the website which I used to select the gray toned colors I used in the map.

## Final Map & Design Process

Above is the final map for Literacy Pittsburgh. Using the Google Styling Wizard, I first started with the Silver theme. I then updated the base color to the light gray color (#F5F5F5) and the water to the blue color (#189CCD). I decided that the roads and highways would look best with the two shades of yellow, with the darker one representing the highways. I used the red accent color in the logo for the primary label text, and the darkest gray color (#4D5258) for the other label text (with the exception of the water labels, which I changed to white). I kept the parks and parcels a subtle gray color so it didn't stand out too much, and also made the transit lines a medium gray color for the same reason.
