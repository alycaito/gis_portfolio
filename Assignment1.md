# Assignment 1 - Web map for Literacy Pittsburgh

### Client and website design
The non-profit I chose to create a custom map for is Literacy Pittsburgh, which provides literacy services to adults and families in Allegheny County and Beaver County. I used to volunteer for this organization as an ESL tutor years ago.

Below is a screenshot from one page of their website to illustrate their color scheme.

### Color Palette

I used the Adobe Color tool to select the color palette from the screenshot I took (see image below). I also took another screenshot of the bottom banner of the website which I used to select the gray toned colors I used in the map.
